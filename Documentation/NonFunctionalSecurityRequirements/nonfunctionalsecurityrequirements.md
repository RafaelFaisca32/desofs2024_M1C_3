# Non-functional Security Requirements

## Performance

- Security measures should not significantly impact system performance.
- Encryption and decryption processes should be optimized to minimize latency.

## Scalability

- The system should be designed to handle an increasing number of users, requests, and data without compromising security.
- Scalability should be considered in terms of both hardware infrastructure and software architecture.

## Availability

- The system should be highly available to ensure users can access it whenever needed.
- Redundancy and failover mechanisms should be in place to mitigate the impact of potential downtime due to security incidents or hardware failures.

## Reliability

- Security mechanisms should be reliable and consistently enforce access controls, encryption, and other security measures.
- Regular security testing and updates should be performed to address vulnerabilities and maintain system reliability.

## Compliance

- Ensure compliance with relevant security standards and regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) depending on the nature of the data being handled.
- Implement features such as data anonymization and user consent management to comply with privacy regulations.
