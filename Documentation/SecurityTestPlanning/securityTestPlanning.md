# Security Testing Process

### Determine the Scope:

- Identify the System or Application for Testing: Our security testing will encompass evaluating the truck management and dispatch application.
- Define the Target Environment: Our testing focus will center on the production environment where the application is deployed, alongside any pertinent development and testing environments.
- Establish Security Objectives: Our primary security objectives are to pinpoint and mitigate potential vulnerabilities that could compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the application and its data.
- Identify Stakeholders: Stakeholders involved in the security testing process include the development team, IT operations team, security team, and any relevant business stakeholders. Additionally, customers, managers, and drivers will play crucial roles. Customers will input service requests into the application, managers will dispatch corresponding services to drivers, and drivers will be responsible for updating service statuses and viewing assigned tasks.
- Define Roles and Responsibilities: It's imperative to clearly outline the roles and responsibilities of each stakeholder involved in the security testing process, including testers, developers, system administrators, and management. Moreover, in our academic environment project, we'll involve customers, managers, and drivers in specific roles as described above.
- Specify Constraints and Assumptions: We must identify any constraints or limitations that may impact the security testing process, such as resource limitations due to academic environment constraints, such as restricted access to paid databases or cloud resources for project deployment. Time constraints will also be a consideration, divided into academic project deadlines and timeframes.
- Determine Types and Levels of Security Testing: We'll specify the types and levels of security testing to be performed, including vulnerability assessment, penetration testing, code review, and compliance audit.
- Ensure Clarity, Realism, and Agreement: The scope must be clearly defined, realistic, and unanimously agreed upon by all parties involved, including academic project stakeholders, to ensure alignment and the successful execution of the security testing plan. In order to achieve that we will perform some weekly meetings and even daily when needed.

### Conduct Risk Assessment:

- Identify potential threats, vulnerabilities, and impacts: For this we will conduct a comprehensive assessment to identify potential security threats and vulnerabilities that could affect the truck management and dispatch application. Considering factors such as unauthorized access, data breaches, denial of service attacks, and insider threats. We will also analyze the potential impacts of these threats on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the application and its data.
- Prioritize risks based on likelihood and severity: In order to achieve that we will evaluate the identified risks based on their likelihood of occurrence and potential severity of impact, prioritize risks accordingly to focus resources on addressing the most significant threats first.
- Define risk mitigation strategies and actions: In this phase we will develop a risk mitigation strategies and action plans to address identified risks effectively. This may include implementing security controls, applying patches and updates, enhancing access controls, and improving monitoring and detection capabilities.
- Document and update the risk assessment: Finally, we will document the findings of the risk assessment, including identified threats, vulnerabilities, impacts, and mitigation strategies. Update the risk assessment regularly throughout the project lifecycle to account for changes in the threat landscape or the application's environment. Ensure that stakeholders are aware of and aligned with the risk assessment findings and mitigation efforts.

### Select Methods and Tools:

- Ensure Consistency, Reliability, and Effectiveness: Our focus will be on choosing methods and tools that demonstrate consistency, reliability, and effectiveness in identifying and addressing security weaknesses specific to our truck management application. Factors such as accuracy, coverage, and usability will guide our selection process.
- Compatibility with System Architecture and Technology: We'll select methods and tools that align with the architecture, technology stack, and functionality of our truck management application. It's crucial to ensure that the chosen tools can adequately test the various components and features of our application.
- Explore a Range of Methods and Tools: Our evaluation will encompass a range of methods and tools, including manual or automated testing, static or dynamic analysis, and open-source or commercial tools such as Sonarqube, Dependency Track, and ZAP. Each option will be carefully assessed for its suitability based on project requirements and constraints.
- Document the Selection Process: We will meticulously document the rationale behind the selection of specific methods and tools, outlining their strengths, limitations, and applicability to our academic project. Transparent documentation will ensure that all stakeholders are well-informed and aligned with our chosen approach for security testing.

### Execute Security Testing:

- Perform Security Testing Activities: We will conduct security testing activities, such as scanning, unit testing, manual testing or auditing, on our truck management and dispatch application as outlined in our academic project's defined scope, methods, and tools.
- Follow Predefined Schedule, Procedure, and Checklist: We will adhere rigorously to a predefined schedule, procedure, and checklist to ensure consistency and comprehensiveness in executing our security testing endeavors. Our adherence to the testing plan will ensure systematic coverage of all facets of the application's security.
- Adhere to Ethical and Legal Standards: It is imperative for us to maintain adherence to ethical and legal standards throughout the security testing process, ensuring that all activities are conducted in a manner that upholds the privacy and integrity of our application and its data. Compliance with relevant regulations, standards, and industry best practices will be paramount to maintaining integrity and legality.
- Monitor and Record Results and Findings: We will continuously monitor the progress of our security testing activities and diligently record the results, findings, and evidence acquired during the testing process. Thorough documentation of identified vulnerabilities, weaknesses, or issues, including severity ratings and potential impacts, will be essential for informed decision-making.
- Communicate Progress and Issues: We will foster transparent communication within our team and with all stakeholders involved in our academic project, including the development team, management, and other relevant parties. Regular updates on the progress and findings of our security testing efforts will be provided, with any significant issues or concerns promptly reported to facilitate timely resolution and decision-making achieved with meetings.

### Report and Communicate:

- Prepare a Comprehensive Security Testing Report: We will compile all relevant information obtained from the security testing process, including the scope, objectives, methods, tools, results, findings, and recommendations, into a detailed report tailored for our truck management and dispatch application.
